      <p>Designed a Database for a Non-Profit company that supported single mothers. Due to government regulations a lot of paper needed to be filled out (per applicant) and kept for many years. The Non-Profit was having trouble keeping track of all of the paperwork and wanted to remove the risk of losing copies. Prototype was created, however implementation was outside the scope of the class project.</p>

      <h5> Distributed Remote Boot Linux With Kali </h5>
      <p>A project designed for my alma mater. Cyber Security organization was struggling to get students to join and particpate in competitions, we found the issue to be that students could not jump into the environment and begin learning due to needing lot's of setup. This project is supposed to solve that issue by allowing a new student to put their machine to PXE boot and have their machine run the OS, but save all files to the remote server. Minimal client side setup required.</p>
